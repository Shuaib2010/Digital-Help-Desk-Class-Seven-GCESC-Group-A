      <h1>Code: S1- Spoofing</h1>
      <h2>Solution and precaution to these:</h2>
      <p>•  Use strong authentication: SPOOFING attacks often rely on weak authentication mechanisms to gain access to systems. By using strong authentication methods, such as multi-factor authentication, you can make it much more difficult for attackers to successfully spoof your identity.<br>
• Use IP filtering: IP filtering allows you to block specific IP addresses from accessing your system. This can be a useful way to prevent known attackers from launching SPOOFING attacks against you.<br>
• Use intrusion detection systems (IDS): IDS systems can monitor your network traffic for suspicious activity, such as large numbers of packets coming from a single IP address or packets with forged source addresses. If an IDS detects suspicious activity, it can alert you or block the traffic automatically.<br>
• Use intrusion prevention systems (IPS): IPS systems are similar to IDS systems, but they can also take action to prevent suspicious activity from happening. For example, an IPS could block packets from a known attacker or drop packets with forged source addresses.<br>
• Keep your software up to date: Software developers often release security patches to fix vulnerabilities that could be exploited by SPOOFING attackers. By keeping your software up to date, you can help to protect yourself from these attacks.
