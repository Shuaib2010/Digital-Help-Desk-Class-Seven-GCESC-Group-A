      <h1>Code: PA2- Phishing Attacks</h1>
      <h2>Solution and precaution to these:</h2>
      <p>•  Educate yourself and your employees about phishing. Phishing attacks are most successful when the victim is unaware of them. By teaching yourself and your employees about how phishing attacks work, you can make it much more difficult for them to fall victim to one.<br>
• Use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication. Weak passwords are an easy target for phishers. Make sure you and your employees use strong, unique passwords for all of your online accounts. You should also enable two-factor authentication whenever possible. This will add an extra layer of security to your accounts, even if your password is compromised.<br>
• Be careful about what links you click on. Phishing attacks often involve sending emails or text messages with links that lead to fake websites. These websites may look like legitimate websites, but they are actually designed to steal your personal information. If you receive a link from someone you don't know, don't click on it. Instead, go to the website directly by typing the address into your web browser.<br>
• Be suspicious of unsolicited emails and phone calls. Phishers often send unsolicited emails and make unsolicited phone calls in an attempt to trick people into revealing their personal information. If you receive an unsolicited email or phone call from someone claiming to be from a company you do business with, be suspicious. Don't give out any personal information until you have verified that the person is actually who they say they are.<br>
• Keep your software up to date. Software updates often include security patches that can help protect you from phishing attacks. Make sure you keep your operating system, web browser, and other software up to date at all times.
