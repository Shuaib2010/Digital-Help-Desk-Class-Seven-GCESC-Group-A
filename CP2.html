      <h1>Code: CP2- Cracking Passwords</h1>
      <h2>Solution and precaution to these:</h2>
      <p>•  Use strong passwords. This means using a password that is at least 12 characters long and includes a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using common words or phrases, as well as any personal information that could be easily guessed, such as your name, birthday, or address.<br>

• Use a passphrase. A passphrase is a string of random words that are strung together to form a password. Passphrases are generally easier to remember than traditional passwords, but they can be much more difficult to crack.<br>

• Use a password manager. A password manager is a software application that helps you to create and store strong passwords for all of your online accounts. Password managers can also generate random passwords for you, which can help to ensure that all of your passwords are unique and secure.<br>

• Enable two-factor authentication (2FA). 2FA adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts by requiring you to enter a code from your phone in addition to your password when logging in. 2FA can help to protect your accounts even if your password is compromised.<br>

• Be careful about where you enter your passwords. Avoid entering your passwords on public computers or unsecured Wi-Fi networks. If you do need to enter your password on a public computer, be sure to use a virtual private network (VPN) to encrypt your traffic.<br>

• Change your passwords regularly. It is a good idea to change your passwords every few months, or immediately if you suspect that your password may have been compromised.
